## **Day 4: LLM Fine-Tuning**
### **Introduction**
* Fine-tuning is like giving a head start to a model and then customizing it to do a specific job better. Imagine you have a really smart friend who knows a lot about many things but needs a bit of help to understand something new. You can teach them about that new thing, making them even better at it.

* For example, think about using a super smart computer program called GPT-3 to help doctors write patient reports. GPT-3 knows a lot about general stuff, but it might not understand all the fancy medical words and phrases. So, you can give it some special training with medical notes and reports. This way, it gets better at understanding medical language and writing reports accurately.

* It's not just for words though. Let's say you have a computer program that's really good at spotting cars in pictures. But when you want it to spot trucks instead, it might not be as good. So, you can fine-tune it by showing it lots of pictures of trucks until it gets better at recognizing them.

* Basically, fine-tuning is about taking a smart program, giving it some extra training on specific things, and making it even smarter for those particular tasks.
### **Why Fine-Tuning?**
Fine-tuning is like giving a super smart model extra training to make it really good at a specific job. Think of it like this: you have a friend who knows a lot about many things but needs a bit of help to understand something new. You teach them about that new thing until they're really good at it. Now, why do we need to do this with smart computer programs? Well, these programs, called large language models, are designed to be good at lots of tasks, but not necessarily great at one specific thing. So, we fine-tune them to be exceptional at a particular job.

Here's why we do it:

* Custom Fit: We want the model to be perfect for the job it's doing, not just okay.\
* Matching Data: Sometimes, the model needs to understand a specific type of information that it wasn't trained on before, so we fine-tune it to learn that new stuff.\
* Saving Time and Money: Instead of starting from scratch, which can be really expensive and take a long time, we use what the model already knows and just tweak it a bit.\
* Handling Different Situations: Sometimes, the model might not understand things that are a bit different from what it's used to. Fine-tuning helps it get better at handling these differences.\
* Sharing Knowledge: The model already knows a lot of general things. Fine-tuning helps it use that knowledge for specific tasks.\
* Making Users Happy: We want the model to work just the way users want it to, so we fine-tune it to match their needs.\
* Staying Up-to-Date: Things change over time, so we fine-tune the model to keep it relevant and useful.\
In simple terms, fine-tuning makes smart computer programs even smarter for the jobs they're meant to do, helping them understand specific things better and work more effectively in the real world.

### **Types of Fine-Tuning**
At a basic level, fine-tuning methods for language models fall into two main types: supervised and unsupervised. In supervised methods, the model learns from labeled data, where each example has a clear desired outcome. Unsupervised methods, however, work with unlabeled data, aiming to uncover patterns and structures without explicit labels.
